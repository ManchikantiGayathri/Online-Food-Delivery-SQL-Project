# Online Food Delivery SQL Project

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of an online food delivery dataset. The primary objective is to extract meaningful insights into customer behavior, restaurant performance, and menu item popularity to support data-driven business decisions. This repository contains the SQL scripts, the dataset, an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, and a project report summarizing the findings.

## Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to analyze the provided online food delivery dataset to identify key trends and patterns related to customer engagement, restaurant operations, and menu item popularity. The insights gained can inform strategic business decisions, such as optimizing marketing campaigns, enhancing menu offerings, and improving operational efficiency.

## Dataset Description

The dataset comprises five tables:
- **`customers`**: Contains customer details such as ID, name, email, city, and signup date.
- **`restaurants`**: Contains restaurant details like ID, name, city, and registration date.
- **`menu_items`**: Lists menu items offered by restaurants, including item ID, restaurant ID, item name, and price.
- **`orders`**: Records order-level details such as order ID, customer ID, restaurant ID, order date, total amount, and order status.
- **`order_details`**: Provides line-item data for each order, including order detail ID, order ID, item ID, quantity, and price at the time of order.

*(Note: In your `tablecontent.sql`, the `restaurants` table is named `restaurent` and `menu_items` is `menu_item`. You might want to be consistent in your README or note the naming difference.)*

## ER Diagram

The Entity-Relationship Diagram illustrates the relationships between the different tables in the database:

## Analysis Questions & Insights

The project addresses several key business questions using SQL queries. Some of the analyses performed include:

1.  **Total Orders by City:** Understanding geographical distribution of orders.
2.  **Revenue Generated by Each Food Item:** Identifying top-performing menu items.
3.  **Top 5 Spending Customers:** Recognizing high-value customers for targeted marketing.
4.  **Restaurant-wise Order Count:** Assessing restaurant performance.
5.  **Monthly Order Trends:** Analyzing seasonal or temporal patterns in orders.
6.  **Top 3 Cities by Revenue:** Pinpointing key markets for expansion or focus.
7.  **Number of Unique Customers Per City:** Gauging customer reach in different areas.
8.  **Most Frequently Ordered Items:** Optimizing inventory and bundling strategies.
9.  **Restaurants with Low Order Counts:** Identifying underperforming partners for review.

Detailed insights and visualizations are available in the [Project Report](Documentation/Online%20Food%20Delivery%20SQL%20Project.pdf).

## Tools Used

* **Database:** SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server - specify if you used a particular one)

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Online-Food-Delivery-SQL-Project.git](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Online-Food-Delivery-SQL-Project.git)
    ```
2.  **Set up Database:**
    * Use the SQL script in `SQL_Queries/tablecontent.sql` to create the database and tables.
    * Load the data from the `.csv` files in the `Data/` directory into their respective tables.
3.  **Run Queries:** Execute the SQL queries in `SQL_Queries/tablecontent.sql` to reproduce the analysis.
4.  **Review Report:** Refer to the `Documentation/Online Food Delivery SQL Project.pdf` for a detailed explanation of the project, insights, and visualizations.

## Certificate of Completion
